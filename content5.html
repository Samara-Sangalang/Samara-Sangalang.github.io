			In order to solve this plaguing problem, I wish to propose a solution specifically tailored for our spoiled
			scholars- it may sound counterintuitive, but it admirably works nonetheless for accomplishing workloads like
			theirs. It is incredibly simple, if they cannot find time to do requirements, they should <span class="emphasis">not</span> sleep, eat, or
			socialize until all workload is done. Their mental and physical well-being <span class="emphasis">could wait</span> for their requirements, as
			their academic requirements are much more important than bodily requirements such as that. If there is a
			factor that prohibits the scholar from doing their requirements on time, they should know better to do them 
			ahead of time- they are Pisay Scholars after all! What is the purpose of being a childhood prodigy and a
			genius if they cannot even tell the possible future, and do their requirements under a short period of time?
