			I propose that such students that cannot keep up with the system be disposed of, any student that finds this
			workload mentally and emotionally taxing is <span class="emphasis">nothing but detrimental</span> to the Philippine Science High School
			community. I suggest sending them out of the school, but before so, I suggest charging them hefty fines for
			not complying in a system they are already out of. As for our remaining scholars, I suggest adding even more
			requirements in their workload. Through some research by browsing the <span class="emphasis">#PisayGiveUsABreak</span> hashtag on
			Twitter, I have concluded that the assigned requirements that we give to our scholars is not enough, as they
			are not learning at all. Learning takes a lot of practice, therefore <span class="emphasis">increasing</span> student workload might help with
			the comprehension of our students. Philippine Science High School Students would catch up flawlessly, as
			they have the mental capacity to cope, after all.
